Other key messages (for internal reference and not included in Q&A)
1. What are the characteristics of Huawei's N-NPS detractor identification? Huawei's N-NPS detractor identification solution is a user-level experience modeling solution based on long and short periods. The short-period solution uses the daily network experience index established by CEI+ to score the daily network experience of each user (comprehensive experience index). N-NPS detractor identification is a long-period user network satisfaction model established based on short periods to identify the possibility (probability) of user network satisfaction depreciation. Customers can better manage and improve user experience based on the probability of long-period network satisfaction depreciation, short-period comprehensive experience index, and poor-QoE identification, demarcation, and locating capabilities provided by CEI+ scenario-based experience management, as well as the perception, cognition, decision-making, execution, and effect evaluation processes. 2. What is the relationship between N-NPS and CEI+? Huawei's N-NPS detractor identification solution uses the experience feature indicator data of CEI+ as the basic input. Therefore, to support N-NPS detractor identification, the CEI+ UC must be deployed in advance so that necessary experience feature indicator data is available and can serve as the input of training data for the network satisfaction model. 3. What is the business model for CEI+ to provide N-NPS? What is the charge mode? For Huawei's N-NPS detractor identification solution, the software+operation service business model is recommended. The software provides basic functions, and the operation service optimizes the model to meet model accuracy requirements. It is recommended that software licenses be controlled by the number of users. 4. Can the N-NPS detractor identification solution fit users' N-NPS survey data and promise the improvement of group N-NPS indicators? The N-NPS detractor identification solution constructs binary labels (detraction: 0–6 points/non-detraction: 7–10 points) based on the N-NPS survey data (0–10 points) and then performs user-level network satisfaction modeling. A binary classification algorithm model is used, which does not fit N-NPS scores. In addition, because N-NPS survey data is subjective and random, data cleaning is necessary (usually mandatory) for N-NPS survey samples. That is, samples that may be randomly scored are deleted, and only high-quality survey samples are retained and used as labeled samples for training and evaluating the network satisfaction model. The N-NPS detractor identification solution helps identify users with a high probability of detraction. Based on the short-period CEI experience index, this solution provides guidance for customers to accurately optimize network experience and reduce the number of detractors on the network. However, the N-NPS indicator improvement cannot be promised because the subjectivity and randomness of N-NPS indicators cannot be eliminated and the indicators are affected by tariffs and services."
